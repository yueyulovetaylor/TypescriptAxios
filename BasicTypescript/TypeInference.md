# Type Inference

## Basics
  * Basic Scenarios of type inference include: (1), Initialize variables and members; (2), set parameter default values; (3), determine function return types.

## Best Common Types
  * The best common type algorithm considers each candidate type and picks the type that is compatible with all the other candidates.

## Contextual Typing
  * Common use cases include function calls, right hand sides of assignments, type assertions, members of object and array literals, and return statements.
